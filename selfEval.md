# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
```
I found the Objects section more straightforward and easy to digest than the past few subjects. 
```
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
```
My note taking has evolved each day this week, and I think I'm at a pretty good spot now. I take the best notes & do cleanup while going through our section outlines and doing the practice work. The worst part is how scattered things are; I have notes in Google Docs, replit, and GitHub. I'd like to hear suggestions for note taking apps that work well with coding, if anyone has ideas to share! I imagine my notes will get messier as we move into more advanced code topics, and as a super organized person that makes me anxious.
```
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
```
If I'm looking for something completely new to me, I'll go straight to Google. If it's something that I've already been exposed to or is similar to something I know, I prefer to try the code out and edit until I get it right. Both are valueable!
